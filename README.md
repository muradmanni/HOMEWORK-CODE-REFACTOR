# HOMEWORK-CODE-REFACTOR
First assignment of Bootcamp

## Description

This is the first assignment for the Bootcamp. Code refactoring was great fun and I have used all the skills and knowledge gained in the past week.

There were semantic tags missing in HTML, also the css file was bloated.

The html code for the webpage is refactored and semantic tags are added in order to acheive accessibility. CSS elements are combined in order to avoid repeatation.
